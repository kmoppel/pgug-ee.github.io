<p>
    Our previous meeting was on 8th December 2017. Our biggest thanks to
    <a href="https://transferwise.com/">TransferWise</a> for providing big and cozy
    meeting place with very fine
    selection of snacks. We used available space well – third event was
    biggest so far with 58 people registering and 50 people actually
    attending. As very pleasant surprise, (IP address based)
    <a href="pgug.ee-nr3-bycountry.png">map of ticket
        sales</a> showed that we actually having international event with some
    people attending from other countries.</p>

<p>
    Agenda was solid – our first speaker <b>Hans-Jürgen Schönig</b> from
    <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/">CYBERTEC</a>
    used one of databases that he
    had to support just before presenting to us as inspiration for his
    talk: <b>“Analyzing large data sets”</b>&nbsp;(<a
        href="pgug_ee_hans_jurgen_large_datasets.pdf">pdf</a>).
    Take real world examples of “seemingly big data situations” that look very familiar. Combine them
    with actual effective solutions. Served with unique charm of Hans… I’d
    say that this talk was very interesting for everyone, irrelevant of
    actual PostgreSQL experience.
</p>

<p>
    As communication and free form chatting is very important part of
    meetings we had extra-long break time. To made it even more
    entertaining, CYBERTEC did bring
    <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/how-we-built-our-cluster-in-a-box/">“cluster in a box”</a>
    demo case showing how robust and easy failover can be with help of
    Patroni. (see about Patroni on
    <a href="pgug.ee/meetings/01">first meeting</a>, earlier
    this year (<a href="https://youtu.be/4N2p5oscCA4">youtube</a>). Break
    was also very tasty one, so I’d like to thank TransferWise once more,
    for being great host for the event.
</p>
<p>On topic of food we continued with
    <b>Federico Campoli</b>, who achieved remarkable “First person to give more
    than one talk in pgug.ee”, presenting us with <b>"PostgreSQL Carbonara"</b>&nbsp(<a
            href="https://gist.github.com/the4thdoctor/b347c18f341b1c35de8e4895c3e29496">gist</a>).
    This tiny talk can be used as simple demo for planning and structuring
    data in PostgreSQL for beginners.
</p>
<p>
    Last but not least, local PostgreSQL star <b>Hannu Krosing</b> gave really
    nice overview of <b>PostgreSQL in NoSQL world</b>. Good overview, going much
    deeper than other JSON/schemaless talks. Performance benchmarks and
    links to more details and useful tools yield something that is of
    interest also to more advanced database users. Whole talk was
    explained in simple, easy to understand language, which maybe will
    allow beginners to make educated decisions when it comes to data
    storage.

    As usual, I’d like to conclude with some links on what’s next:
