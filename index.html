      On this quiet evening we will be visited by CEO of Cybertec -
      Hans-Jürgen Schönig. He presents things in simple, understandable yet
      very charming and bit funny manner. His talk is titled "Analyzing
      large data sets". In this talk we get an overview about means how to
      handle a lot of data using means that PostgreSQL has built in.
      <br/>
<br/>
      PostgreSQL is good everywhere, but will it blend? We bring most
      advanced open source database in the kitchen. "PostgreSQL Carbonara"
      is lightning talk that will be presented by Federico Campoli from
      TransferWise. Note: Federico will be first person ever who has given
      two talks in our local group!
      <br/>

      NoSQL is still buzzword; we supposed to trade in ACID for usability…
      but instead SQL replied with inclusion of SQL/JSON in ISO/IEC
      9075:2016. Why NoSQL matters, and how to implement common scenarios in
      PostgreSQL will be presented in talk titled "PostgreSQL as NoSQL
      Database". Presenter Hannu Krosing from 2ndQuadrant is well known in
      local community.
